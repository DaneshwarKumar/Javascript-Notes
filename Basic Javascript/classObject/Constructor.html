    /*
    Constructor : 
    The constructor() method is a special method for creating and initializing objects created within a class.
    The constructor() method is called automatically when object is created of class , and it has to have the exact name "constructor", 
    in fact, if you do not have a constructor method, JavaScript will add an invisible and empty constructor method.

  Note: A class cannot have more than one constructor() method. This will throw a SyntaxError.
        You can use the super() method to call the constructor of a parent class

class Car {
  constructor(brand) {   
    this.BrandName = brand;
  }
}

let mycar = new Car("Ford");

console.log(mycar.BrandName);
