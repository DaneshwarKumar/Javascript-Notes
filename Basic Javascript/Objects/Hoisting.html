    <!-- JavaScript Declarations are Hoisted
      * In JavaScript, a variable can be declared after it has been used.

      * In other words; a variable can be used before it has been declared. 

      * Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations 
        to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the current function) --> 

    <script>

        console.log(greet);

        var greet;
        greet = 'Hellow !';


       hellow();

       function hellow(){
         console.log("Hellow Wolrd");
       }

    </script>




<!-- 
The let and const Keywords: 

* Variables defined with let and const are hoisted to the top of the block, but not initialized.
Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, but it cannot be used until it has been declared.

*Using a let variable before it is declared will result in a ReferenceError.
The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until it is declared
 -->


 <script>

    console.log(carName);
    let carName = "nano";


    console.log(bikeName);
    let bikeName = "pulsare220";
